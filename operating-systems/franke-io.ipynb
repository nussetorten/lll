    "Interrupts are facts of live, but should be hidden away, so that as little of the OS as possible knows about them.  The best way to hide interrupts is to have the driver starting an IO operation block until IO has completed and the interrupt occurs.  When interrupt happens, the interrupt handler handles the interrupt.  Once the handling of interrupt is done, the interrupt handler unblocks the device driver that started it.  This model works if drivers Re structured as kernel [rpcesses with their own states, stacks, and program counters."
